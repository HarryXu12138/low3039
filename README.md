Fork this repository, clone it on your computer and add a file with your First Name,
Last Name, Project Name, Slack Username and send a pull request so that we can merge it.
Ask any of the mentors if you need help with this process. Call it your firstname + 
last name .md 
(For me it would be AdeetPhanse.md)
